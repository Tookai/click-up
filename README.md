# Kanban Board Application


### Made with :
- Next JS
- Prisma
- React Query
- React Beautiful DND


### Note :
The db is a local sqlite file which is pushed in this repo. You should not do that. This is for example purpose.

To run this repo you dont need any .env values

At the moment I am writting this, the drag and drop doest handle the position inside the column so a "moved" ticket will always be at the start of the column.
